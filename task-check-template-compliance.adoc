BlueXP can monitor the parameter values used when a resource was created with a template using the "drift" feature. Drift identifies resources that have been changed and that are no longer compliant with the template settings.

At this time, drift identifies the changed parameters in a resource -- you must manually make adjustments to the resource to bring it back into compliance with the template. In the future we'll be able to send you notifications when a resource is out of compliance, or even reverse a user's change so that all resources created from a template are brought back into compliance automatically.

== How does drift work

Drift identifies non-compliant parameters like this:

. When creating a template, you turn drift on for certain parameters that you do not want users to change. For example, you may require that Snapshot copies are created using the "Default" policy for all volumes created from a template.

. You turn drift on for the template, and then save the template.

. Storage admins run the template to create volumes.

. Later, a storage admin edits a volume and disables Snapshot copies.

. You run drift checking on all templates, and the AppTemplates service compares the Snapshot copies template setting to the current setting in the volume. Any non-compliant values are flagged so you can fix the incorrect setting.

== The Drift Dashboard

The Drift Dashboard shows the total number of resources (for example, volumes) that have been created using your templates, the number that are still compliant with the template, the number that are not compliant (drifted), and the number that were created with Drift disabled.

* The controls at the top of each column allow you to sort the results in numerical or alphabetical order.
* The image:screenshot_plus_icon.gif[] enables you to filter the results by Template Name, Drift Policy & Status, and Action Type. For example:
+

* The search bar enables you to search for a specific volume name or template name.
* To find out more details about the actual resource (or volume), such as the working environment and storage VM, you can click the image:screenshot_sync_status_icon.gif[].

== Populate the Drift Dashboard

You must run drift checking on a template before it populates the values in the Drift Dashboard.

You can run drift checking for all templates from the Templates Dashboard:

You can run drift checking on a single template from the Templates Dashboard:

image:screenshot_template_drift_for_one.png[A screenshot showing how to run drift checking for a single template.]

== Create a drift report for non-compliant resources

You can view a drift report for a single resource, or run a report to download a report for all resources. Using this report you can assign actions to system admins to make changes that bring the resources back into compliance with the template.

You can click the Drift icon for a resource in the Drift Dashboard to view a list of the parameters in each resource that is non-compliant.

To view a drift report for resources that have been created from your templates, click image:button_download.png[] to download a .CSV file. The drift report reflects what is currently filtered on the page - it does not show all resources unless you haven't applied any filters on the page.

=== Replication health details in the drift report

When link:task-define-templates.html#add-replication-functionality-to-a-volume[enabling Replication on a volume using templates], you can choose to show more detailed replication information in the drift report by enabling drift in the "Enable replication health monitoring" field. When enabled, the drift report shows whether the health of the Replication relationship is healthy or unhealthy (drifted), along with the SnapMirror lag time, status, and last transfer time.

This screenshot shows the replication details for a SnapMirror relationship that is unhealthy in the drift report.

*Note:* As replication is initially being applied to the volume the health will be returned as "False", meaning it is unhealthy. After a few minutes the real replication status will be displayed.
